# Exploratory and Confirmatory Modeling of Unequally Spaced Time-series Data
Materials for the workshop on "Exploratory and Confirmatory Modeling of Unequally Spaced Time-series Data", part of the 3rd International Symposium on N=1 Designs, April 2023.

The workshop consists of two parts, of which each consists of a lecture and practical component. 

Part 1 covers confirmatory modeling, with the practical part focusing on the estimation of **continuous-time** models using the `ctsem` package in `R`.

Part 2 covers exploratory modeling, with the practical focusing on estimation of auto- and cross-correlations from unequally spaced time series, using the `expct` package in `R`. 

## Preparation
The workshop will primarily use the `R` programming language, of which we assume working knowledge. R can be downloaded from [cran](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/base/old/). 
We also require users to make use of a variety of `R` packages. To install and check that these packages function correctly, we have supplied a script, `setup.R`. Please install all software and packages before the start of the workshop.


## Workshop Files

You can follow the lab parts of the sessions by opening the `.html` file of Part 1 and Part 2. The practicals will involve analyzing real and simulated data, provided in the `data` folder.
